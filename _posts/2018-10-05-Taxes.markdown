Republican politiicians just gave their wealthiest friends a huge tax cut.  And  - get this - they said (wink, wink) it was going to pay for itself 

(Just like the Reagan tax cuts were supposed to, but ballooned the deficit instead, and just like the Bush tax cuts were supposed to but busted the budget again.. You'd think we'd get it by now, that giant tax cuts for the wealthy wreck the budget... but someone's always lined up at the trough)  

And guess what? This latest one didn't pay for itself. So the wealthy folks who fund their campaigns got their tax cut, and ordinary Americans are now saddled with a recordsetting budget deficit, all thanks to "fiscally responsible" Republican politicians.

But don't worry, Republicans have a plan.  Cancel those tax cuts for the wealthy? Nope. They're just going to cry "deficit crisis" and... wait for it... try to cut Medicare and Social Security. 

Don't get fooled again.  Don't get suckered into paying for someone else's greed with your money and your health care.  Vote to balance the budget and protect Spcial Security and Medicare. Vote for Democrats this fall.
